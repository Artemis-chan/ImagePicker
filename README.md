# ImagePicker

A simple application to select and insert image data from a folder to other apps.

Initially made this to easily post image stickers in Discord, WhatsApp(web). It could also be used to use as a fast and easy access to pattern library(and similar things) while creating 2d art or designs.

## Usage
* Alt + E to open
* Ctrl+Alt+Q or use taskbar icon to completely stop it.
* Typing in text field will show images that contain the phrase in their names.
* You can add pictures to folder when it's running and it'll update next time the text field is modified.
## Installation
* Download latest version [here](https://github.com/Artemis-chan/ImagePicker/releases/latest).
* Extract the folder.
* Put the necessary images in **images** folder.
* Run **ImagePicker.exe** (or create a shortcut and run that).
* Wait for a taskbar message after it's initialized.
